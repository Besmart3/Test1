  <h2>⚫️Step 1</h2>
  <p class="para1"> First you wan't to gather everything you need to make bananpancakes, this step is pretty easy as you'll find out in a few minutes. 
        <br /> 
        As you may think we'll need bananas, 4 will be enough to make pancakes for 4 persons. As well, for 4 bananas you'll need 2eggs.
        <br /> This all you will need for the whole recipe ! Isn't it great ?</p>
<br /><br />
  <h2>⚫️Step 2</h2>
  <p class="para2">Now, you want to make a banana purée in bowl using a fork or whatever you have under your hand, this will work well enough.
         <br />Once your bananas are scrambled in a purée with the less pieces of banana as possible you want to add the 2 eggs after crushing them, do not keep the shell ! 
        <br />I know you would be able to do this, you dumbass...</p>
<br /><br />

<h2>⚫️Step 3</h2>
<p class="para3">Yeaaah you now have your pancake mix, try it if you want but it will be better once cooked.
    <br />To cook it, just take a pan, put in on a low power fire and put a big spoon of your new prepared banana pancake mix in it, wait 5 min for it to be well cooked on the side. 
    <br />then flip your pancake and then wait another 3 minutes. now they're ready to be served.
     <br />Tip: you can put multiple pancakes in a single pan to go faster.</p>
